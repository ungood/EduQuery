EduQuery
========

EduQuery is a educational project in the spirit of [EduLinq](https://github.com/ungood/EduLinq) to
further investigate LINQ: especially the IQueryable interface and how it compares to IEnumerable.  We
will do so by building our own simple LINQ-enabled ORM that is robust enough to run a simple ASP.NET
MVC web application.
